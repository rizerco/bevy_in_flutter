# Bevy in App

Integrate the [Bevy engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) into existing iOS | Android apps.

If you want to add a mini-game to an existing app, or implement some dynamic UI components, charts ..., or just want to take advantage of the **Motion Sensors** on your phone for some cool gameplay, you can't use `WinitPlugin`. Because `winit` will take over the entire app initialization process and windowing, but we need to create `bevy::App` in an existing app instance, and we may also want `bevy::App` to run in an `iOS UIView` or `Android SurfaceView` of any size.

This repository implements such a scenario and uses the phone's motion sensor to play breakout mini-games.

## **iOS**

```sh
# Add iOS target
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios

# Build for iOS target
sh ./ios_build.sh --release
```

Then, Open `iOS/bevy_in_iOS.xcodeproj` with Xcodeï¼Œconnect an iOS device and run.

## **Android**

### Set up Android environment

Assuming your computer already has Android Studio installed, go to `Android Studio` > `Tools` > `SDK Manager` > `Android SDK` > `SDK Tools`. Check the following options for installation and click OK.

- [x] Android SDK Build-Tools
- [x] Android SDK Command-line Tools
- [x] NDK(Side by side)

Then, set two following environment variables:

```sh
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
# Replace the NDK version number with the version you installed
export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/ndk/23.1.7779620
```

### Add build targets

```sh
# Since simulator and virtual devices only support GLES,
# `x86_64-linux-android` and `i686-linux-android` targets are not necessary
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
```

### Build

```sh
# Install cargo-so subcommand
cargo install cargo-so

# Build
sh ./android_build.sh --release
```
